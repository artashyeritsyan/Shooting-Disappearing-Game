# Shooting & Disappearing

This project is a game inspired by classic retro games. You will control a character, shooting into empty space to fill horizontal lines and earn points.

## How to Play

1. **Controls:** Use the arrow keys to move the player left and right (you can also use 'a' and 'd' keys). The up arrow/space/w key will shoot.
2. **Line Clearing:** When a horizontal line is filled without gaps, it will disappear, and you'll earn points.
3. **Game Over:** The game ends when the stack of blocks reaches the player figure.

## Compilation and Running

To compile the game, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `Game` directory.
2. Run the command `make`.

This will build the necessary files and create the executable file for the game.

## System Requirements

To compile and run this game, you'll need a C/C++ compiler and the make utility.
